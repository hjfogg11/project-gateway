GameBay might be blocked on your device, so in that case you can go to [tinyurl.com/exthang3r-exploit](https://www.tinyurl.com/exthang3r-exploit), copy everything and paste it into your search bar, and follow the instructions on the page. Go to [gamebay.vercel.app](https://gamebay.vercel.app) to play! You can also download games from this repo.
Project Genesis is an in development games and tools site for students to use in their free time at school. Most games and tools will be pulled from [Blobby Boi's](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi) repositories, so credit to him. If GameBay is blocked on your Chromebook by an extension, you can go to [tinyurl.com/exthang3r-exploit](https://www.tinyurl.com/exthang3r-exploit). This is a Microsoft Word document with ExtHang3r, an exploit made by Blobby Boi. Copy everything in that document and paste it into your search bar, then adjust the slider to whatever your Chromebook can handle. This may take a few attempts. Then click Hang Extension and wait. Once the button appears, click Kill Extension, then go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), find the extension, click Details, then turn Allow access to file URLs on and off, and that will disable the extension for an amount of time. Go to [genesis.vercel.app](https://genesis.vercel.app) to start playing!
